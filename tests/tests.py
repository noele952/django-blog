class BlogTests(TestCase):
    """
    Test suite for the 'blog' application in the Django project.

    This class includes various tests to verify the correct behavior of
    components within the 'blog' app. The tests use Django's TestCase
    framework to simulate and assert application behavior in an isolated
    environment.

    This may include, but is not limited to:
        - Model functionality and constraints.
        - View and template rendering.
        - API endpoints (if applicable).

    Attributes:
        None explicitly defined yet. Tests will be added as methods.

    Methods:
        Any test methods will follow Django's conventions, where each test
        method should begin with 'test_' to ensure it is recognized by the
        testing framework.
